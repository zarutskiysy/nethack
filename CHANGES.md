# Changes over the parent engine (pf_s25p)

- **eL1fe's fixes** (ported from eL1fe/nethacker@cfc3828, its `dag25` engine = this same base): the spell-direction fix
  (`Agent.cast` sent the compass string as keys: every aimed cast was wasted), force bolt for Wizards (from
  CleverShovel 0d1fb22: never into shops, never flying on into a pet), healing spells for any role that knows them,
  stoning cures, a known teleport scroll as a last resort, no throwing where the pet may stand unseen, Wizards and
  Healers keep off metal body armor/gloves/heavy shields (spell failure), Archeologists dig out of shops, magic
  mapping from Dlvl 3, trees unwalkable, Sokoban/altar robustness, and the Dlvl-1-only grind kept for Rogues only.
  (I found the cast bug independently; eL1fe's version is used.)
- **Identity router** as in daglar-dragomirov/nethacker@e29eb82 (the verified-tier leader): Healers (pf_hg, pf_hh),
  human Priests (pf_pa) and Samurai (pf_v35) play specialist engines; everyone else plays nhbot with DIVE_XL 8
  (nhbot is then identical to e29eb82's pf_base apart from the changes listed here).
- `roles.py`: per-identity overrides of engine settings (only for nhbot identities).
- `MEDUSA_HOP` (off pending A/B): on Medusa's level with no dry square on our islet, step into a one-square moat
  channel toward land that has one (trap.c drown(): the hero crawls out at once to a random free land square).
- `MINES_TOOL_TRIP` (on; +0.018 +- 0.007 per game over 272 paired held-out games): a tool-less planned dive takes the Mines route for any race (it was for
  dwarves and gnomes only), so humans, elves and orcs go and take a dwarf's pick-axe.
