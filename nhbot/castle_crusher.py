"""PASSTUNE_CRUSHER (castle-redteam lane, ledger F104): the castle's drawbridge as a weapon, for a kit that carries a
tonal instrument (7 of 105 true castle kits: fire horn 3, frost horn 2, tooled horn 2, wooden/magic flute 2).

NetHack 3.6.6 facts this is built on:
* music.c do_play_instrument (~690-838): any instrument but a drum asks 'Improvise?' (not while stunned, confused or
  hallucinating: then it improvises); 'n' asks 'What tune are you playing? [5 notes, A-G]'. On the castle level, with
  the drawbridge span (05,08) or its portcullis (06,08) inside our 3x3, a wrong tune gives Mastermind feedback
  ('You hear N tumblers click and M gears turn.'; nothing at all for 0 and 0) and the right one opens or closes the
  bridge and makes the tune known ('Play the passtune?' from then on). passtune.py solves it: ~5.2 plays, max 7.
* dbridge.c do_entity (560-760): CLOSING the bridge kills every non-flyer that isn't a wall-walker or a ghost on the
  span (jumps 4 in 10 and drowns in the raised span's water, else rides it in to the portcullis and is crushed) and on
  the portcullis (2 in 10 jump onto the span and drown, else crushed). OPENING it crushes whatever swims under the
  span. Flyers dodge 5/8 on the span, 2/8 on the portcullis. The kills are ours (e_died -> xkilled: XP).
* The crusher square (04,07) (or (04,09)) is diagonal to the span and in the tune's 3x3, but in line with no square
  of the antechamber ((06,07)/(06,09) are wall), so nothing inside can throw or zap at us; the only castle-side square
  next to us is the span. Elbereth there holds the eels, sharks and the whole court; the @ soldiers ignore it but
  must stand on the span to reach us, and at speed 10 vs our 12-16 we close the bridge before their blow.
* makemon.c ~1318: the drawbridge eels are generated asleep 4 times in 5, and a stealthy Valkyrie never disturbs them.
  Soldiers and court are awake (no M3_WAITFORU) and walk toward us, one at a time through the portcullis.
* Then in along row 08 (castle_front.FrontDoor's FRONT_V3 walk-in, lures back to the crusher when 2+ come): at a
  castle on Dlvl 29 through the throne room to the locked secret door (38,08) and the trap door (40,08) -- the
  Valley, Dlvl 30; at any other depth to a corner tower's chest for the wand of wishing, named by one zap so that
  WISH_TELEPORT_ROUTE (tele_route) spends its wishes (as CASTLE_TREASURY hands it over).

Milestones: 'CRUSH M:<name>' (start, square, tune, open, crush, crush_over, throne, secret, trapdoor, tower, chest,
wand, stop) and 'CRUSH kill ...' lines, for the harness measurement.
