"""FRONT_DOOR (castle-front lane): the castle's front door as a banked gamble for a kit with no lift.

The castle depth is already scored when we stand on its level, so a death here costs nothing. A kit whose passage
plan gave up ('nothing that crosses water') and that holds a known wand of striking or opening goes in by the front:

* do.c boulder_hits_pool(): a boulder pushed into the moat fills it 90% of the time ('Now you can cross it!'); pushed
  into the raised span (05,08) it sets DB_FLOOR under the bridge. A cold ray over the span sets DB_ICE (zap.c).
* zap.c bhit(): a striking bolt east along row 08 passes the raised span and destroys the drawbridge at the
  portcullis wall (06,08). dbridge.c destroy_drawbridge(): the span becomes MOAT, or ROOM/ICE when filled or frozen
  first ('The drawbridge disintegrates!'); the portcullis a doorless doorway; iron-chain debris scatters within one
  square; wake_nearto(500) wakes everything within ~22 squares (the antechamber's 8 soldiers and lieutenant). A
  wand of opening at the portcullis lowers the bridge instead: a dry span at once.
  So: fill first, then open from (03,08), two squares off the span (debris, the drawbridge eels at (05,07)/(05,09)).
* The span's only castle-side neighbour is the doorway (06,08) ((06,07)/(06,09) are wall), so the soldiers (@: they
  ignore Elbereth) come out one at a time; we hold (04,08), where the one on the span is the only one in reach (and a
  polearm from the doorway).
* Then the antechamber (07..14,05..11), the closed door (15,08), the unlit hallway (16..25,08), the closed door
  (26,08) and the throne room (27..37,05..11) with 27 awake court monsters (L N E H M O R T X Z, all respect
  Elbereth). The castle's wand of wishing lies in a chest in one of the four corner towers (castle.des $place).

Milestones are logged as 'FRONT M:<name>' for the harness measurement (dev/scenarios/castle-front.json).
