"""WISH_TELEPORT_ROUTE: a wand of wishing -> the bottom of Gehennom by two controlled level teleports.

teleport.c level_tele(): with teleport control, any level asked for past the bottom of the Dungeons of Doom is
find_hell() -- the Valley of the Dead, castle depth + 1 -- from ANY level of the Dungeons, Dlvl 1 included; from
Gehennom a big number clamps to the vibrating-square level (bottom-1; the Sanctum needs the invocation), Dlvl
~44-52. read.c seffects(): a cursed (or confused) scroll of teleportation calls level_tele(), and noteleport
levels don't stop it (only Sokoban, the endgame and carrying the Amulet do). LEVELPORT_DEEP answers the prompt
with 50 (the top of the progress table). So a ring of teleport control plus two cursed scrolls of teleportation
score 0.78-0.81 wherever we are, past Medusa, the castle and the Valley in two turns.

A wand of wishing always gives two wishes: the engrave-test wish, rnd(3) - 1 more charges, and one wrested
charge (zap.c zappable(): 1 chance in 121 per zap at 0 charges; the wand then turns to dust). Dev evidence:
base3-jf14 s14 and s8, base4arm/base5arm-jf16 s5 found a wand of wishing on Dlvl 1-3 (2-4 wishes, spent on gray
dragon scale mail and life saving) and died at Dlvl 25-28.

WISH_CHARGING_FIRST: the first wish from the wand is '2 blessed scrolls of charging'. The route's wishes zap the wand
down to (x:0) (the first 'Nothing happens' tells an unknown count), then one scroll is read on it: read.c recharge()
gives a never-recharged wand of wishing 3 charges (blessed; a second recharge explodes it), i.e. c + 2 wishes in all.

  route_wish(agent)                  the next wish the route still needs, or None
  note_wished(agent, text, letter)   remember where the wished (cursed) scrolls went
  teleport_route_strategy(agent)     put the ring on, wrest the wand, read the scrolls
