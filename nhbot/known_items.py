"""dive-audit lane (jf_config.KNOWN_ITEMS): in mortal danger while diving, use the KNOWN item that ends the danger
before emergency_strategy's last resort gambles on unknown ones.

Evidence (cand-g = s24 = 6ec6675, 270 fresh pinned games jf43-60; ledger F092). 77 of the 171 deaths with an
inventory log (prep-metric's PREP_LOG twins, jf43-54) held a known escape or attack item they never used: ~30 scrolls
of teleportation, ~15 wands of striking, wands of sleep/fire/cold/lightning, healing potions. In the Dlvl 5-20 band:
  * jf45 s14: a mumak on Mines 4 took 79 -> 43 -> 15 -> dead; the pack held a known wand of sleep and a blessed scroll
    of teleportation;
  * jf52 s9 / jf54 s14: blinded by a yellow light, then a soldier ant (75 -> 0 in 7 turns) / killer bees; 2 uncursed
    scrolls of teleportation / a scroll of teleportation and wands of cold and fire;
  * jf49 s7: stuck to a giant mimic on Dlvl 20 with a scroll of teleportation; jf48 s8: a soldier on Dlvl 10, the same.
Why they sat unused: the last resort (agent.emergency_strategy) tries only UNKNOWN wands, potions and scrolls; fight2
zaps only ray wands (item.is_offensive_usable_wand: never striking, a beam, never sleep); nothing reads a known scroll
of teleportation or quaffs a known healing potion in a fight; and the last resort waits for pray.c's critically low HP
(1/6 of max at XL 6-13), which a 20-40-a-turn attacker skips straight over (jf45 s14: 43 -> 15 -> dead).

While diving (the Dungeons, the Mines, Gehennom), not polymorphed, engulfed or afloat, with a hostile next to us -- or
hurt this badly with one within 7 -- and either
  (a) critically low HP (agent._critically_low_hp, the last resort's trigger), or
  (b) a burst: the HP lost over the last KNOWN_ITEMS_BURST_TURNS turns is at least what is left, below
      KNOWN_ITEMS_BURST_FRAC of max HP (the next such exchange kills us),
and no safe emergency prayer due (that goes first: mino_guard.MinoGuard._prayer_first), the guard takes the first of:
  1. the up staircase we stand on, unless an M2_STALK monster next to us would follow (monst.c: trolls, soldiers...);
  2. a known scroll of teleportation where teleports work (MinoGuard._teleport_ok: not the castle, Medusa's level,
     the Valley, Sokoban -- their .des FLAGS: noteleport -- nor an unrecognised level at Medusa's depth with water) --
     never a known-cursed one or WISH_TELEPORT_ROUTE's stack (power_route's level-teleport tickets), never with
     teleport control known (the scroll would ask where). Readable blind: read.c doread refuses a blind read only of a
     scroll never seen (dknown);
  3. a known wand of teleportation at ourselves (the same levels);
  4. a known wand of digging down, unless an M2_STALK monster next to us would follow through the hole (jf47 s10's
     ice troll followed three zapped holes);
  5. a known potion of full or extra healing (plain healing only at critically low HP: 6d4);
  6. at the strongest attacker next to us: a known wand of sleep (or the engrave-tested 'sleep or death' pair, at
     critically low HP), a ray -- only with KNOWN_ITEMS_RAY_RUN free squares behind it or at critically low HP; a known
     wand of striking (a beam: no bounce); a known wand of cold (Valkyries resist its bounce); fire next to us;
     lightning / magic missile only with room for the ray to die out.
No zap in Minetown or with a peaceful (a watchman, a shopkeeper) on the line (fight_heur.missiles_risk_the_watch), no
teleport with unpaid shop goods in the pack (theft). No danger while an intact Elbereth under us holds everything next
to us and nothing has hurt us through it, and never a zap at a monster that Elbereth scares from it (mon.c setmangry:
'You feel like a hypocrite', -5 alignment, the engraving deleted -- da-all2 jf54 s2 did that to a mumak). Every action is logged 'KNOWN_ITEMS ...'. A minotaur in view is
mino_guard's (above us in global_strategy).
Targeted pinned replays (19b5f85, KNOWN_ITEMS on vs cand-g): jf45 s14 0.117 -> 0.647 (the blessed scroll at 15/79 HP
next to the mumak, then the castle), jf52 s9 0.075 -> 0.466 (read blind at 27/75 under the soldier ant), jf48 s8
0.126 -> 0.393, jf49 s7 0.379 -> 0.466; jf54 s1 unchanged (5 striking zaps killed the sergeant and a soldier, then the
wand was empty); jf50 s14 unchanged (its wand of fire was known empty).
