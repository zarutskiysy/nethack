"""The fast ways off the castle's west side. castle_logic.py has the geometry and the full crossing (float round the
moat to the back door); this module holds the preempts that get a hero onto the moat, or through a wall to a trap
door, before the west side kills it. Preempts in global_logic.global_strategy (flag values as shipped):

  rush_strategy        CFP_RUSH, with CFP_MB, CL_POTION_EARLY and CL_ROUTE (ON): put on a possible lasting lift at
                       once, quaff lift potions on the landing, then dig/float the cheapest way to a far moat entry
  known_rush_strategy  LIFT_KNOWN_RUSH (ON): a KNOWN lasting lift goes on the moment we land where castle arrivals land
  xorn_strategy        CFP_XORN (ON): a wall-walking polymorph form walks through the walls to a trap door
  plunge_strategy      LIFT_PLUNGE (ON): on a castle trap door and not levitating, '>' drops us into the Valley
  cold_strategy        LIFT_COLD (OFF): the short cold route (freeze one moat row, walk it)

castle_logic's crossing calls blocker_zap and door_zap_from_afar (CFP_ZAP: the latter opens the locked back door
(56,08) from two or more squares away; EAST_LATE_DOOR keeps it shut while a timed lift lasts) and held_elbereth /
door_sea_fight (CFP_EEL); castle_power calls poly_prep.

The rest of this docstring is castle-first-pass's analysis behind CFP_*; the later work (CL_*, LIFT_*) is explained
in the section comments above its code and in jf_config.py.

castle-first-pass: getting a lifted hero off the castle's west landing and into the moat before it dies there.

Why (castle-first-pass, 2026-09-27; NetHack 3.6.6 castle.des / sp_lev.c / trap.c / dig.c):

* Real Dlvl-29 castle arrivals die on the west side within 5-50 turns, before castle_logic's plan (which runs at the
  bottom of the preempt chain, under fight2 / elbereth_rest / the scare hold) ever tries an item. cfp-p2-jf16 s0
  (pinned clock): landed T10981 at map (-2,2) with an uncursed ring of levitation among 3 unknown rings, a master
  lich (a covetous court monster: it teleports next to the hero, wizard.c tactics -> mnexto) arrived at T10985, a
  soldier ant and an elf-lord joined; dead at T11006 with the ring never put on.
* Over the moat nothing that walks can reach us: land monsters can't enter water, and mnexto/enexto only put a
  covetous lich on a square it can stand on. The channel along map row 0 (x 1-8) has only undiggable stone
  above it and the NW tower's wall below it -- no land square next to it at all.
* The west maze touches the moat ring's west column (map x 0, rows 0-5 and 11-16) along its whole length, and the
  maze walls outside the castle map are diggable (castle.des NON_DIGGABLE covers the map only). So from any
  landing spot a straight dig reaches (-1,2) [north] or (-1,14) [south], one diagonal float from (0,1) / (0,15):
  9 water squares to the dry strip instead of the 14 from the courtyard corner, and no walk through the maze to
  the courtyard (where 34 of 38 castle minotaur first hits came, castle-breach F055).
* Horizontal digging works while levitating (apply.c use_pick_axe2 checks Levitation only for u.dz != 0).
* An amulet of magical breathing makes us Amphibious (youprop.h): stepping into the moat is 'You fall into the water.
  But you aren't drowning. You touch bottom.' (trap.c drown) and we walk on along the moat bottom -- a lasting way
  round the ring that no castle_logic path used (0 of 6 MB-kit harness games crossed: the amulet was only put on
  against eel wraps). Amulets say nothing when put on, so an unknown one is tested by that very step from the dug
  launch square: without magical breathing drown() lets us crawl back out onto it ('Pheew! That was close.'),
  wet but alive. A breathless or amphibious polymorph form is Amphibious the same way (mondata.h amphibious()).
  Under water each move may be turned aside ('Water turbulence', mkmaze.c water_friction: 1 in 3), and climbing
  out needs at most Burdened (hack.c domove); sea monsters still bite, but an eel's wrap can't drown us.

CFP_RUSH: on the castle's west side, not yet on the moat ring, as a preempt above fight2 / elbereth_rest / the scare
hold / deep_poly_escape (below castle_logic's crossing strategy and the emergency layer):
  1. not floating: put on / wear what may be a LASTING lift right away -- a known ring of levitation or
     levitation/water walking boots, then each unknown ring, then (CFP_MB) unknown amulets that may be magical
     breathing, then unknown boots of a magic appearance (the kit's potions stay for castle_logic: a timed lift is
     quaffed where the crossing starts);
  2. floating (or amphibious, or wearing an amulet still to be water-tested): dig/float straight to the launch
     square and on onto the moat, attacking only what blocks the way (no throwing: a levitating thrower hurtles
     backwards, castle-c4 seed 1 'killed by bumping into a wall').
castle_logic's crossing strategy takes over as soon as we are on the moat ring (castle.committed()).
CFP_ZAP: a sea monster (or anything) blocking the way round is zapped with the best known wand first: teleportation
(u_teleport_mon works on the noteleport castle, F055), then striking (a beam: no bounce), then sleep/fire/cold/
lightning/magic missile rays only along a stretch long enough that the ray can't bounce back at us.
