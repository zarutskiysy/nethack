"""Ported verbatim from vkurenkov/nethack@4921bc3 autoascend/medusa_reentry.py (research/competitor_scan2.md N1,
research/medusa_v10.md); hooks in dive_logic.update / reentry_strategy and global_logic.

MEDUSA_REENTRY (jf_config): leave a wet Medusa island by the '<' and fall in again through the hole we dug above.

NetHack 3.6.6, the facts this rests on (ledger I322):
  * dig.c digactualhole(HOLE) at the hero: goto_level(dlevel + 1) -- the FIRST fall through a hole we dig is exactly one level
    (ledger F306). But the hole stays on the level as a trap (HOLE, seen).
  * trap.c dotrap() -> fall_through(): every later entry -- walking onto the known hole, or '>' on it after 'You escape a
    hole' (do.c dodown: uescaped_shaft -> dotrap(TOOKPLUNGE)) -- picks the destination with
        newlevel = dunlev; do { newlevel++ } while (!rn2(4) && newlevel < bottom);
    so one entry in four skips the level below: from the level above Medusa it lands on the maze (or the castle) under her.
  * Medusa-3's '<' lies in medusa.des STAIR:(32,01,39,07) -- on the raven island that every fall from above lands on -- and a
    raven (monst.c: M2_WANDER | M2_HOSTILE, no M2_STALK) never follows up the stairs.
So a landing that finds no dry square (Medusa-3: all 18 island squares have a moat neighbour, a pick-axe hole floods with
1 - 1/(k+1)^2 and the ravens gather meanwhile) walks to the '<' and climbs, rests above, and steps into the hole again: each
entry is a 1 in 4 chance to skip Medusa's level altogether, and a fresh random landing otherwise. The first climb finds the
hole we fell through (if the known map reaches it) or digs a new one beside the '>' (the default dive logic does that, the '>'
being avoided), which is then one step from the '>' for every later entry.

dive_logic.DiveLogic.reentry_strategy() wraps plan()/act() as a preempt layer next to raven_cycle (global_logic).

The pieces (all flagged, see jf_config's medusa lane block for the evidence):
  * plan() -> _standoff_plan(): on Medusa-3's island, hold an intact Elbereth until a window is open (sight, HP, no hostile within
    max(4, steps to the '<' + 2)), a blind hold writes again only when hurt, the hold gives up after MEDUSA_STANDOFF_MAX(_OK)
    turns or when something hurts us on an Elbereth that stood intact the observation before;
  * plan() -> _medusa_plan(): climb at once (no dig on the island), walk to the '<' round the monsters (_walk_step: a bounded
    BFS over the walkable squares not taken by a monster, an Elbereth when every closer square is taken), Elbereth before the
    walk when two ravens are next to us;
  * plan() -> _above_plan(): on the level above, wait for sight, rest to MEDUSA_REENTRY_REST, step onto (or '>' on) the recorded
    hole, else leave the digging of a new one beside the '>' to the dive;
  * _with_meal(): the layer loops above the dive's eaters, so a Hungry hero eats at the next idle action.
A walk, a hold or a rest is one game action per call; reentry_strategy loops plan() -> act() until the plan ends."""
