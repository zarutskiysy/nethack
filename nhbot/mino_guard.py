"""minotaur lane (jf_config.MINO_GUARD): keep minotaurs from ending the dive -- in the filler mazes between Medusa and
the castle (mkmaze.c fill_empty_maze: rn2(3) minotaurs per level) and in the castle's west maze.

Evidence (cmp-main = 99e4eb7, 90 pinned games): minotaurs killed 23 of 90 games. Of the 17 on dev sets, 7 died on a
maze level 0-9 turns after the landing (jf14 s0/s9, jf16 s10, jf41 s0/s13, jf42 s5/s7) and 10 on the castle. A
minotaur (monst.c: 15HD, speed 15, 3d10/3d10/2d8 at to-hit 25+, MR 0) takes ~42 HP a turn, so an XL-8 digger (~80 HP)
lives two turns next to one; it ignores Elbereth (monmove.c onscary); and every attack, hit or miss, stops the dig
occupation (mhitu stop_occupation) while the occupation only runs on a move of ours the minotaur doesn't answer, so
the hole (8 dwarf moves: apply, 2 digs to the pit -- which resets the effort -- apply, 4 digs) is out of reach once it
is adjacent. Replays with the MINO kit log (mino-diag-*, byte-identical to cmp-main): 3 of the 7 maze deaths carried
a known item that ends the fight in one action and never used it -- jf14 s0 a scroll of genocide, jf16 s10 two
uncursed scrolls of teleportation (and the '<' one step away), jf41 s13 a wand of teleportation -- and two more an
unknown wand or scroll to gamble on. The minotaur is usually in view first at 2-4 squares (dwarvish infravision,
M3_INFRAVISIBLE), 1-3 turns before its first blow.

While a minotaur is in view within MINO_RANGE (one action per step; best first):
  0. a due emergency prayer (critically low HP, safe) goes first: emergency_strategy (3 invulnerable turns, full HP);
     on a scroll of scare monster (ours) on a diggable level: dig on (onscary: a minotaur respects the scroll, and a
     scared monster doesn't stop the occupation, hack.c monster_nearby);
  1. a known wand of digging zapped down (not on the castle: Can_dig_down is false there);
  2. a known wand at it in a straight line: teleportation / polymorph (beams, no bounce), sleep (a ray: it hits the
     minotaur first; a bounce may put us to sleep too, but its sleep adds up on the way back);
 2a. MON_SLEEP_FIGHT (off): a Monk's sleep spell at it in line (a Monk resists its own ray);
  3. on an up staircase: climb (a minotaur has no M2_STALK: it never follows); that '>' is then avoided a while;
  4. where teleports work (not the castle, Medusa, the Valley, Sokoban): a known wand of teleportation at ourselves,
     a known scroll of teleportation (a cursed one level-teleports -- away too);
  5. a known scroll of genocide (not while confused: that genocides us): 'minotaur' (blessed: the class 'H');
  6. a known scroll of scare monster: drop it and dig from it;
  7. death / sleep-or-death (the engrave test can't tell them apart) in line -- a bounce may come back at us (a wall
     within ~3 squares), but next to a minotaur nothing else left gives better odds;
  8. the up staircase within MINO_STAIRS_STEPS steps;
  9. a known wand of cold (Valkyries resist its bounce), fire or lightning next to us: 6d6 a pass, and a corridor
     bounces the ray through it twice (15d8 = ~67 HP);
 10. an unknown wand at it in line (the best P(sleep/death/teleportation/polymorph), castle_power's odds);
 11. where teleports work and it is within 5: an unknown scroll (P(teleportation + scare monster + taming + genocide)
     is ~15% for an unknown label; the effects that don't help cost only the turn).
And: every minotaur in view frozen by our sleep ray -> dig out now; while one was seen on this level lately the dive
doesn't rest (mino_alert: it hunts us -- monmove.c set_apparxy knows where we are).
